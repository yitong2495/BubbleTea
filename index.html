                    An incredibly unique looking beverage, Bubble tea is a
                    Taiwanese recipe made by blending a tea base with milk,
                    fruit and fruit juices, then adding the signature “bubbles”
                    - yummy tapioca pearls that sit at the bottom. Tapioca
                    pearls, which sit at the bottom of the cup have a chewy
                    consistency somewhere between jelly and chewing gum. You can
                    get different flavoured pearls and they are usually black,
                    but sometimes white or transparent, making the drink look
                    rather similar to a passionfruit.
